* Simple Project to learn about zmq socket library

** Dependencies 
   - Docker 
   - Git
   - gcc
   - cmake
     
** Running the server 
   
Running the server is done by the following shell commands: 

#+begin_src bash

git clone --recursive https://github.com/c-porto/zmq-sqlite3.git 
cd zmq-sqlite3/server && docker compose up --build -d

#+end_src

** Testing the server
   
To test the server is possible to use the client, to do that run the following commands from the root of the project:

#+begin_src bash

cd client 
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . && ./zmqclient

#+end_src

** TODO's
   
- Adding docker to client
- Saving logs in a sqlite3 database
- Adding docker compose in the project's root
